> **Upload a table. Ask anything. TabClaw figures out the rest.**

TabClaw is a local AI agent for table analysis. Drop in a CSV or Excel file, describe what you want in plain language — filter, aggregate, compare, visualize patterns, merge datasets — and watch it work step by step. No SQL. No code. No cloud.

## What makes TabClaw different

### 🗺️ It plans before it acts
Before touching your data, TabClaw drafts a step-by-step execution plan and shows it to you. You can reorder steps, rewrite them, or add new ones — then approve and execute. After finishing, it does a self-check to make sure nothing was missed.

### 🤖 Multiple agents work in parallel
When you upload more than one table and ask a comparative question, TabClaw automatically assigns a dedicated analyst agent to each table. They run in parallel, then an aggregator synthesises their findings — highlighting where results agree (**[CONSENSUS]**) and where they conflict (**[UNCERTAIN]**).

### 🧠 It learns from every session
After completing a non-trivial task, TabClaw reflects on what it did and distils the pattern into a reusable **custom skill**. Next time you ask something similar, it calls that skill directly. The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

### 💾 It remembers your preferences
TabClaw picks up on how you like to work — preferred metrics, output format, domain terminology — and carries that context into every future conversation. You can view, edit, or clear memory anytime from the sidebar.

### 🙋 It asks when it's not sure
If a request could reasonably mean several different things, TabClaw pauses and presents you with a concise set of clarification options before proceeding. No silent wrong assumptions.

### 🛠️ Fully extensible
You can define your own skills — write a prompt template or drop in Python code — and the agent will call them just like built-in skills. Combined with skill learning, TabClaw gradually builds a library tailored to your specific workflows.
